## Introduction
**Inspired by the [Sanity: Descent Into Madness](https://github.com/croissantnova/SanityDescentIntoMadness) mod, players will gain some bad effects when in low sanity. Textures modified from Sanity: Descent Into Madness by croissantnova ([consent](https://s21.ax1x.com/2025/02/02/pEZa9S0.png)). Sound effects provided by [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com).**
## Features
**Most feature support custom configurations. Turn to mod's config file for more information. _Since version 1.3.3, you need Baubles mod as dependency._**
### Garland
**Each garland has 60 durability in total, use any small flowers to craft it. Water, fire, lightning, and explosion can lead to damage it while wearing on head. (Equipped in armor or baubles slot)**
### Umbrella
**Holding an umbrella can prevent player from decreasing sanity and damaging garland by rain. Umbrella has 120 durability, which will damage from lightning, fire, explosion. And break or attack can also damage it.**

### CraftTweaker
**Add a ZenExpansion for [IPlayer](https://docs.blamejared.com/1.12/en/Vanilla/Players/IPlayer) (`sanity`), which will return player's sanity value as float. Developers can call this method on any [IPlayer](https://docs.blamejared.com/1.12/en/Vanilla/Players/IPlayer) object, including its subtypes.**
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.event.BlockHarvestDropsEvent;

events.onBlockHarvestDrops(function(event as BlockHarvestDropsEvent) {
    if(!event.world.isRemote()) {
        var id = event.block.definition.id;
        if (id == "minecraft:red_flower" && event.player.sanity <= 10) {
            event.drops = [<minecraft:deadbush> % 100];
        }
    }
});
```
**This *example* script makes any small flowers drop a dead bush when broken by a player with sanity of 10 or less.**
### Thaumcraft 6
**Warp in [Thaumcraft 6](https://ftbwiki.org/Thaumcraft_6) can affect player's max sanity. `max = 100 - warp` (permanent value and normal value, no more than 50)**
